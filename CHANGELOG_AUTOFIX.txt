Changelog - automated fixes applied

1. Workflow (.github/workflows/m3u_Generator.yml)
   - Upgraded checkout to actions/checkout@v3 and added explicit permissions: contents: write
   - Added setup-python step and safer commit/push logic that skips commit if no changes.

2. autorun.sh
   - Hardened script: sets strict bash options, installs requirements.txt when present, captures stderr to last_run_error.log for diagnostics.

3. requirements.txt
   - Added default requirements: requests, yt-dlp, beautifulsoup4

4. scripts/youtube_m3ugrabber.py
   - Backed up original file and added a yt-dlp fallback wrapper that attempts to extract HLS/m3u8 stream URLs if present.
   - NOTE: the fallback requires yt-dlp to be installed (listed in requirements.txt).

Limitations:
- This environment cannot run network installs or call out to YouTube, so I could not fully run the workflow or validate live extraction.
- I prepared a patch and a fixed ZIP you can run locally or push to GitHub. See instructions in the README.
