# Patches applied by assistant

See CHANGELOG_AUTOFIX.txt for a summary of changes.

To test locally:
1. Unzip this repo and run:
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   chmod +x autorun.sh
   ./autorun.sh

To apply on GitHub:
- Commit the changes to a branch and open a PR.
- Or replace files directly on the main branch (if you are comfortable).

If you want me to create a PR automatically, provide a GitHub personal access token with repo scope in a secure way and tell me which branch name to use. I can instead give you a patch file to apply.
